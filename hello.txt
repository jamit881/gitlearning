Hello everyone
this is my first day of learning
git init -> to initialized
file is untracked bcoz file is created before init
git add -> to add in statge for the first time
git status changed to commit
git status -> to check git status
git commit -m "" m for message
git log -> to see all commit
added some lines and made changes to file something edited , deleted etc.
now git status -> modified
again same procedure add commit ...
