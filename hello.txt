Hello everyone
this is my first day of learning
git init -> to initialized
file is untracked bcoz file is created before init
git add -> to add in statge for the first time
git status changed to commit
git status -> to check git status
git commit -m "" m for message
git log -> to see all commit
added some lines and made changes to file something edited , deleted etc.
now git status -> modified
again same procedure add commit ...
made file named git command
added some command to git comand file
git com is untracked file
to track no need to initialized since file made after git init
so simply git add and commit
made changes to hello.txt
